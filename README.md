# MITACS_PROJECT2 (CNN Classifier)
In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural network-based framework in PyTorch to identify brain stimulation-induced EEG features. EEG data were collected from 30 subjects with 5 different conditions: sham/20Hz/70Hz/individual β/individual γ tACS brain stimulation.
