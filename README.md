# MITACS_PROJECT2
With LabVIEW, motor task with visual feedback using the hand gripper was programmed. The motor task consists of 3 different visual feedback gain levels (low, medium, high).

‘final_motortask.txt’ - Paradigm script for the modified visual feedback gain experiment.
‘motor_task.m’ - MATLAB code to generate the Paradigm script.
‘Performance_analysis.m’ - MATLAB code to compute the reaction time and force error of subjects.
